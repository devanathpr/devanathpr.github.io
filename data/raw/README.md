This file contains a merged and standardized list of top 25 productive Indian-funding agencies as indexed in the Funding Agency field of the Web of Science database.
The original data was substantially inconsistent due to the absence of standardized naming conventions for funding agencies and institutions. Identical agencies frequently appeared under multiple name variants, which result in a highly fragmented and non-unique dataset.
To address this, each funding agency name, along with its associated institution, grants and projects, was manually reviewed and carefully validated. A Python dictionary–based mapping was then applied to merge variant entries into standard agency names, producing a cleaned and consolidated dataset.

This curated version is intended to support reliable analysis and reproducibility.
