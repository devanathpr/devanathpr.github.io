This file contains a standardised list of top 25 productive Indian-funding agencies as indexed in the Web of Science database.
The original data was non-unique with funding agency names. So, each funding agency name, along with its associated institution, grants and projects, was manually reviewed and carefully validated. A Python dictionary–based mapping was then applied to merge variant entries into standard agency names, creating a clean dataset.

This version is intended to support reliable analysis and reproducibility of the data we used for Indian-funded research assessment project.
